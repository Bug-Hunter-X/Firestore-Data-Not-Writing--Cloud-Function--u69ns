This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when writing data to Firestore from within a Firebase Cloud Function. The issue was that the data was not being written, even though the set() method returned successfully without errors.  The solution involved adding a console log within the set() promise to verify data actually reached Firestore. The solution demonstrates the use of proper error handling and logging to help identify this kind of subtle bug.
